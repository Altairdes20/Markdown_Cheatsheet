### Fenced Code Blocks :
Use `for` loop

```javascript
var name = "Keras";
console.log(name)
```

---
### Tables :
To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column‚Äôs header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

| Table | Goes | Here |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| One  |  Two | Three|

##### Alignment:
You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (`:`) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

### Subscript & Superscript:
For subscript, use `<sub> </sub>`  and for superscipt use `<sup> </sup>`
e.g. f(x) = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c , H<sub>2</sub>O.

---
### Footnotes :
Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
